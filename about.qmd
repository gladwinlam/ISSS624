Hello there! I am Gladwin. I am a current Postgraduate student with SMU doing analytics.

I would like to use this site to showcase some of my work in geospatial analytics which is a pretty niche area.

In my free time i enjoy exploring outdoors and greeneries. I love cycling and all things that involves speed! :D
